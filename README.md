# Info
- I have only run it on Linux.
- run 'python3 cli.py --help' for execution info. (or read help.txt)
- I have not provided any sample RSS feeds on gh but you can find a sample on this pastebin:

This little program scrapes user-specified RSS feeds for all available article titles, then generates a matrix effect in the terminal that reflects the word count distribution of the scraped data.
